    <section>
      <h1>LOG-IN</h1> <!--PREVENT THE DEFAULT REFRESHING PAGE OF THE FORM : ANG NOW WE CAN FETCH
                          IN THE FRONT-END IN THE JS FILE AND GETTING BACK THE ANSWER AND APPEND TO THE
                          SAME HTML PAGE !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
                          By this solution we don't have to remove the form or to force ourselves
                          getting to the path in the form 'action' attribute and then to have the
                          res from server overwrite the page
                          AND HERE WE HAVE A SOLUTION ALSO IN STATIC PAGES
                          WE DON'T HAVE TO WAIT TO SOLUTION WITH DYNAMIC PAGES AND PASS PARAMS-->
